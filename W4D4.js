/*
    We're rocking 2 algos again today: prepend and append values.

    Prepend => 2 parameters: valueToFind, valueToAdd
    - Find the node with a value of valueToFind, and add a new node with a value of
    valueToAdd before it.

    EXAMPLE: 
    someList = H: 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 ->

    someList.prepend(2, 3) would make someList H: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 ->

    Append => 2 parameters: valueToFind, valueToAdd
    - Find the node with a value of valueToFind, and add a new node with a value of
    valueToAdd after it.

    EXAMPLE:
    someList = H: 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 11 ->

    someList.append(4, 5) would make someList H: 7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 ->

    SOME EDGE CASES:
    - What if the list is empty?
    - What if the value I'm looking for isn't there?
        - You can just return False in that case.
