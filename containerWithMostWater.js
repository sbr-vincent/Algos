*/

/* 
Finds the container that can hold the most water based on its area.
A container's length is the distance between indexes and the two sides are
the heights at those indexes.

/* 
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical
lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and
(i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such
that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
