/*
    Key focus of the day? Removing a node from the middle of a SLL.
    Let's think about this. If we have:
    H: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 ->

    And we want to remove the node with a value of 3, how might we do this?
    The end result should look something like:
    H: 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 ->

    Well in that case, all we really need to do is move 4's .next to be 3's .next, right?
    Right.

    With that in mind...

    Two challenges today!

    Challenge 1: moveMinToFront()
    Write a method that will find the node with the smallest value, and move it to the front. 
    EXAMPLE:
    H: 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 ->
    would become
    H: 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 

    Challenge 2: moveMaxToBack()
    Write a method that will find the node with the largest value, and move it to the back.
    EXAMPLE:
    H: 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 18 -> 2 -> 4 ->
    would become
    H: 1 -> 7 -> 11 -> 2 -> 4 -> 18 ->

    BONUS: 
    Don't use the addToFront/addToBack functions or their logic
